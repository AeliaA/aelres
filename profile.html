		I'm Aelia, and I'm a web junkie and a think-tank. Web search evaluation is my profession, and web exploration is my passion.
		I love to explore cool new websites, web apps and web resources - and all things web. But I also love to work with the code and content. I design and develop websites as well as create apps and content. I also keep myself updated about the latest in the web world. (Oh yes, I'm an internet geek!). In my free time, I also carry out preaching and volunteering activities for various organisations. 
		After graduating with a professional Computer Science and IT degree, I started my career working as a web content writer. Then onwards, while I progressed as a freelance writer, I started boosting my web design knowledge and experience. Currently, I am expanding my skill-set to boost my career. 
		During the course of my studies and work, I developed valuable soft skills such as networking skills, business knowledge, entrepreneurial skills, international exposure, creative ideas, and the like.
		Apart from all the personal and professional life activities, I am into many other areas. I love experimenting and experiencing everything, so that I grow and develop in every way.
